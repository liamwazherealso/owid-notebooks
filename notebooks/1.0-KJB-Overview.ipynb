To develop full series back to 1800 for all countries, Gapminder combines published estimates within the academic literature and national statistics, with their own guesstimates and extrapolations for countries without published estimates.

It provides country-level data on the start and end year of sovereignty; year in which universal suffrage was granted to all women; the year the first woman was elected to parliament; and percentage share of women in parliament for the years 1893-2003. OWID updates their data through to 2017 using Inter-parliamentary union (IPU) statistical archives and the World Bank’s World Development Indicator (WDI) variable on women’s share in parliament (main sources). \\nData from 2003 onwards was derived from various other sources. IPU’s statistical archives were used to derive figures on the share of women in parliament (from 2004-2017); the CIA World Factbook provided data on the year of sovereignty and universal suffrage, alongside various additional sources which are listed below. Moreover, data extension to 2017 means that our dataset consists of five additional countries: Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan and Timor, which gained independence after 2003.\\n\\nData construction:\\nPaxton et al (2006) describes women’s political representation as the share of sovereign countries which satisfied the five representation milestones in any given year. Therefore, we have constructed this dataset which indicates the status of sovereign countries using the values \"Yes\" and \"No\". More specifically, if the year of universal suffrage is less than 1990 for the United States, we coded ‘Universal suffrage to women’ in the United States in 1990 as Yes. Note that the United States had gained sovereignty by then. \\nIn addition, our dataset doesn’t consider these milestones as ordered achievements in women’s political representation. Paxton et al (2006) assumed that a country can only elect a woman MP once the universal suffrage has been granted. However, there are countries whereby a female MP was elected prior to gaining universal suffrage. Therefore, we calculate values for each milestone independently and map countries as per the original source definition of sovereign.\\n\\nAdditional data sources: \\nThis section provides detailed information on the sources used by variables and countries.\\n\\nYear of sovereignty \\nCIA’s World Factbook Independence field is used to determine the year of sovereignty for Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan, Timor, American Samoa, Hungary and Iran.

For each year, we take the share of women in lower house of the parliament. This definition matches both with WDI and IPU’s Women in Parliament 1945-1995. They use the share of women in single house for unicameral parliaments and lower house for bicameral parliaments. Moreover, for consistency, data is taken from December every year. If December data is missing, we take the next latest month of the corresponding year.\\nHandling data issues: \\nFor years 1997 - 2003, there is an overlap between Paxton’s dataset and WDI data measuring the share of women in parliament. For most countries, the values match exactly. However, there are 20-40 countries each year where the Paxton and WDI values do not match. As the more complete and comprehensive dataset, we have taken Paxton’s dataset as our primary source in such cases for the period 1997-2003. Nonetheless, we use WDI to fill the remaining gaps. For the same reasoning, we choose manually collected data from IPU’s statistical archive over WDI for the years 2004-2016.'}]\n",

It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.\"}]\n",

For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.\"}]\n",

In some studies and reports, education is included in social spending. This is not the case in this dataset.\\n\\nHandling of underlying sources\\n\\nThis dataset was constructed by combining three sources. These are the OECD Social Expenditure Database (OECD SOCX), OECD (1985) and Lindert (2004).\\n\\nThese three sources were combined as follows. For the period 1980-2016 we report the figures as published in OECD SOCX. For the period 1960-1979, we extended the recent figures (from OECD SOCX) backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD (1985). And for the period 1880-1930, we took observations from Lindert (2004).\\n\\nTo be precise, the data for the period 1960-1979 was obtained by relying on the earliest available observation from OECD SOCX, and then successively extending the series backwards by using the year-by-year rate of change implied by the estimates in OECD (1985). Here is an example:\\n\\nOECD_SOCX_(Year-1) = [OECD_SOCX_(Year)] x [OECD_1985_(year-1)]/[ OECD_1985_(year)]\\n\\nBackward extrapolation for the period 1960-1979 was necessary because the levels in the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) do not exactly coincide for the overlapping years. The implicit assumption, then, is that the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) have different levels, but common trends.\\n\\nIn this visualization (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/various-measures-of-social-expenditure-as-share-of-gdp?country=AUS) you can see how the various underlying sources compare to our constructed series.\\n\\nFurther remarks\\n\\nAccording to the Manual to the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX), the OECD defines social expenditure as “The provision by public and private institutions of benefits to, and financial contributions targeted at, households and individuals in order to provide support during circumstances which adversely affect their welfare, provided that the provision of the benefits and financial contributions constitutes neither a direct payment for a particular good or service nor an individual contract or transfer”\\n\\nThe series on Social expenditure for France and Denmark in OECD(1985) are not complete. However, Lindert (2004) uses the data available to estimate social expenditure in 1960 and 1970. Therefore, we use his estimations to extrapolate backwards for those two points in time.\\n\\nIn OECD (1985) social expenditure figures include expenditure on education. To ensure consistency with Lindert (2004) and OECD (SOCX), we subtracted education.'}]\n",

The quality and quantity of data vary across countries and time periods, which makes it not well-suited for time-series analyses. OWID uses two of their variables - military expenditure (milex) and military personnel (milper) - to construct this dataset. BOE exchange rates and US CPI are used to convert milex figures in constant US$. This allows comparison among countries in different years but with limitations. Finally, to extend milex series till 2016, figures from SIPRI’s Military Expenditure Database are spliced for the years 2013-2016.\\n\\nHosts of the NMC dataset, Professor Michael Greig and Professor Andrew Enterline, explain that the aim was to create a dataset which allowed for annual comparisons of the relative capabilities of states/countries in the international system. So NMC dataset is best for cross-sectional comparisons. Detailed description of original data is available here: http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities/nmc-codebook-v5-1. However, military expenditure figures have been converted in constant currency units previously such as by SIPRI, World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) and Military Expenditures and Economic Growth, Castillo et al (2001). Thus, to be transparent and acknowledge data limitations, we explain below the way OWID has generated this dataset.\\n\\nData construction:\\nMilitary Personnel (milper)\\nMilper values were originally given in thousands. OWID multiplies those figures by thousand to produce the variable ‘Military personnel’. NMC dataset also reports total population of the country in a given year. The variable ‘Military personnel relative to total population’ is generated by taking the ratio of ‘Military personnel’ and ‘Total population’.\\nMilitary Expenditure (milex)\\nNMC dataset converted expenditure figures from national currency into a standard unit. However, it reports milex in thousands British pounds sterling prior to 1914 and in thousands US dollars thereafter. The decision to report milex in such a way reflects that UK was a dominant power before 1914 and US after that. We reconstruct milex data in the following way:\\nWe multiply milex values from NMC dataset by thousands. It gives military expenditure in British pounds from 1816-1913 and in US dollars from 1914-2012. We add to these, the milex values from SIPRI’s Database in US$ from 2013-2016. \\nEven though SIPRI provides milex values from 1949-2016, NMC dataset by COW Project is more complete for the overlapping years. Thus, we choose NMC dataset as our main dataset.\\nTo convert milex into current US$ from 1816-1913, we use exchange rates from Bank of England (BOE) dataset. As a result, we get military expenditures in current US$ for the entire period 1816-2012. \\nPlease note that we use BOE exchange rates because the original COW exchange rates are not available. While we are aware that using a different exchange rates for the period preceding 1914 introduces noise to the series, we believe that this does not affect trends or levels in any systematic way. It simply adds to the margin of error that historical estimates already had.\\nThen, we use US Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 1816-2016 to adjust for inflation. OWID uses 2015 as the base year i.e. price deflator in 2015 = 1. After dividing milex in current US$ by price deflator, we get military expenditure in constant 2015 US dollars. \\nSIPRI also provides milex data in constant 2015 US$. While the OWID reconstructed figures follow the same trend, two series are different. It is due to difference in methodologies used. SIPRI uses individual country’s CPI to first adjust for inflation, and then market exchange to convert national currency in 2015 US$. If there were perfect markets, both approaches should give same result as exchange rates would reflect changes in relative value of each currency over time.\\nFinally, for all three variables - Military expenditure, Military expenditure in current US$ and Military expenditure in constant US$ - we take their ratio relative to the total population to express variables in per capita terms.'}]\n",

Military personnel estimates include active, regular military units of the land, naval, and air components. Troops in the reserves such as those found in the United States were not included in the state’s annual total. Colonial troops (such as Indian troops under British command during India’s colonial period) were usually not included in this total if they were a separately administered force.\\n\\n2. The military personnel data exclude the military forces of foreign military forces, semi-autonomous states and protectorates, and insurgent troops. Such units were not part of a regular national armed force under a military chain of command. Their inclusion would distort the number of personnel that could be summoned when deemed necessary.\\n\\n3. Figures reflect the project's best judgement on which forces were intended for combat with foreign parties. Irregular forces such as civil defense units, frontier guards, gendarmerie, carabineri, and other quasi-military units were nominally responsible for defending outlying districts or for internal security and could be mobilized in time of war. We usually excluded them, however, because they were not integral to the regular armed forces (e.g. Cossack troops of nineteenth century Russia). When these forces were the only military a nation had they were still excluded (e.g. Costa Rica and Switzerland).\\n\\n4. Armed forces in several semi-feudal nations, including the warlord armies in pre-modern Japan and China, and Jannissary troops in the Ottoman Empire: We counted only those forces that were acting at the behest of the central government. For example, we included only the Imperial troops and those armies of feudal lords operating on the behalf of the throne in the case of pre-modern Japan.\\n\\n5. National police forces organized for both foreign and domestic purposes and found in several developing nations in the twentieth century: Such units come directly under the military chain of command and are fully a part of the armed forces at the immediate disposal of a national government. Examples include the old National Guard of Nicaragua and the national police forces of many African states. When such forces provided dual functions of foreign combat and internal security, we included them in its military personnel figures; otherwise, they were excluded\\n\\nFor further information please see: http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities/nmc-codebook-v5-1/at_download/file)\"}]\n",

(2018) using a combination of the IMF World Economic Outlook, and multiple Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). \\n\\nThe SSPs are defined broadly as follows:\\n- SSP1: low challenges for both climate change adaptation and mitigation resulting from income growth which does not rely heavily on natural resources and technological change, coupled with low fertility rate and high educational attainment.\\n\\n- SSP2: the benchmark scenario and assumes the continuation of current global socioeconomic trends at the global level. \\n\\n- SSP3: low economic growth coupled with low educational attainment levels and high population growth at the global level are the main elements of the narrative, which is characterized by high mitigation and adaptation challenges.\\n\\n- SSP4: presents a narrative of worldwide polarization, with high income countries exhibiting relatively high growth rates of income, while developing economies present low levels of education, high fertility and economic stagnation.\\n\\n- SSP5: presents a scenario with high economic growth (and therefore low adaptation challenges) coupled with high demand for fossil energy from developing economies, but with high global CO2 emissions.\\n\\nSSP2 is defined as the baseline 'business-as-usual' scenario. \\n\\nThe categories of 'extremely fragile', 'fragile' and 'non-fragile' have been added for reference based on the OECD (2018) States of Fragility framework. This framework measures the fragility of countries based on multiple political and socioeconomic indicators. More information on this fragility measure can be found at the OECD (2018) report.\\n\\nReference: OECD (2018), States of Fragility. OECD Publishing, Paris.

Seattle, United States: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 2017.', 'dataPublisherSource': 'Census data.', 'link': 'http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool', 'retrievedDate': '24/10/2017', 'additionalInfo': 'The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reports the age-standardized death rates by cause and risk factors for any given year.\\r\\nThe age-standardized death rate measures the incidence of mortality per 100,000 individuals, normalised to a standardized population size and age distribution. This standardisation allows for fair comparison of death rates by correcting for differences in population size and changes in the age distribution across countries and through time. This gives an appropriate measure of the probability of death for any given individual from a certain risk factor or cause.\\r\\nIt is important to understand the distinction between risk factors and causes of deaths. Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: \"the underlying cause of death refers to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury.\" Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.\\r\\nRisk factors are particular behaviors or lifestyle factors which affect the probability of incidence of particular diseases and causes of death. For example, tobacco smoking is a risk factor which increases the probability of lung cancer. In this case, it is not tobacco smoking in itself which is the cause of death, but the increased incidence of lung cancer.\\r\\nIn order to identify and highlight the specific behaviours, lifestyle factors - and thereby the potential intervention points for prevention of mortality - this data presents a mix of causes of death and risk factors. Many of the variables are straightforward causes of death - such as road accidents, drowning, fire, malaria, terrorism fatalities. However, for non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer, diabetes, which can form a complex combination of preceding behaviour and lifestyle factors we have instead presented the IHME\\'s attributed figures by risk factors, including high blood pressure, obesity, high blood sugar & tobacco smoking. Identification of these factors is more conducive to highlighting the specific behaviours or preventative factors which can be addressed in order to improve health outcomes and reduce mortality rates.\\r\\nCauses and risk factors are further clarified as follows:\\r\\n\\'Outdoor air pollution\\' refers to outdoor/ambient exposure to particulate matter (PM) and ozone.\\r\\n\\'Drug use\\' refers to the use of cannabis, opioids, or amphetamines, or use of injecting drugs [does not include tobacco or alcohol]. This is distinguished from \\'drug disorders\\' which refers to direct death as a result of drug dependence and drug abuse.\\r\\n\\'Alcohol disorders\\' refers to death as a result of alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse; this is distinguishable from \\'alcohol use\\', which is premature death as a result of general alcohol consumption which is linked to increased risk of certain diseases.\\r\\n\\'Road accidents\\' includes deaths from all road vehicles, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Nutritional deficiencies\\' are defined as protein-energy malnutrition, iodine, vitamin-A, and iron deficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'}]\n",

Even in countries where the parliament vigilantly reviews budgets and spending, military expenditures and arms transfers rarely receive close scrutiny or full, public disclosure (see Ball 1984 and Happe and Wakeman-Linn 1994). However, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has adopted a definition of military expenditure derived from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) former definition (in use until 2002; see Definitions).\\n\\nIn the many cases where SIPRI cannot make independent estimates, it uses the national data provided. Because of the differences in definitions and the difficulty in verifying the accuracy and completeness of data, data on military expenditures are not always comparable across countries. However, SIPRI puts a high priority on ensuring that the data series for each country is comparable over time.\\n\\nGeneral comments: Data for some countries are based on partial or uncertain data or rough estimates.\\n\\nStatistical concept and methodology: SIPRI military expenditure data includes military and civil personnel, including retirement pensions and social services for military personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; military research and development; and military aid (in the military expenditures of the donor country). Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, and weapons conversion and destruction. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require more detailed information than is available about military budgets and off-budget military expenditures (for example, whether military budgets cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, and military pensions).\\n\\nSIPRI data for the most recent years include two types of estimate which apply to all countries: (a) figures for the most recent years are for adopted budgets, budget estimates or revised estimates, and are revised, more often than not, in subsequent years; and (b) the deflator used for the latest year in the series is an estimate SIPRI's primary source of military expenditure data is official data provided by national governments. These data are derived from budget documents, defense white papers, and other public documents from official government agencies, including government responses to questionnaires sent by SIPRI, the UNODA, or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Secondary sources include international statistics, such as those of NATO and the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Other secondary sources include country reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit, country reports by IMF staff, and specialist journals and newspapers.\\n\\nThe data on military expenditures as a share of GDP are SIPRI estimates. The SIPRI military expenditure figures are presented on a calendar-year basis. The only exception is the USA, for which statistics report data on a fiscal-year basis. Calendar-year data are calculated on the assumption of an even rate of expenditure throughout the fiscal year. The ratio of military expenditure to GDP is calculated in domestic currency at current prices and for calendar years.\\n\\nThe SIPRI military expenditure figures are presented on a calendar-year basis.

It consists of nine categories, which are defined below.\\n\\n1 = ASSASSINATION\\nAn act whose primary objective is to kill one or more specific, prominent individuals. Usually carried out on persons of some note, such as highranking military officers, government officials, celebrities, etc. Not to include attacks on non-specific members of a targeted group. The killing of a police officer would be an armed assault unless there is reason to believe the attackers singled out a particularly prominent officer for assassination.\\n\\n2 = ARMED ASSAULT\\nAn attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly to human beings by use of a firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife, etc.). Not to include attacks involving the use of fists, rocks, sticks, or other handheld (less-than-lethal) weapons. Also includes attacks involving certain classes of explosive devices in addition to firearms, incendiaries, or sharp instruments. The explosive device subcategories that are included in this classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive devices that are thrown.\\n\\n3 = BOMBING/EXPLOSION\\nAn attack where the primary effects are caused by an energetically unstable material undergoing rapid decomposition and releasing a pressure wave that causes physical damage to the surrounding environment. Can include either high or low explosives (including a dirty bomb) but does not include a nuclear explosive device that releases energy from fission and/or fusion, or an incendiary device where decomposition takes place at a much slower rate. If an attack involves certain classes of explosive devices along with firearms, incendiaries, or sharp objects, then the attack is coded as an armed assault only. The explosive device subcategories that are included in this classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive devices that are thrown in which the bombers are also using firearms or incendiary devices.\\n\\n4 = HIJACKING\\nAn act whose primary objective is to take control of a vehicle such as an aircraft, boat, bus, etc. for the purpose of diverting it to an unprogrammed  destination, force the release of prisoners, or some other political objective. Obtaining payment of a ransom should not the sole purpose of a Hijacking, but can be one element of the incident so long as additional objectives have also been stated. Hijackings are distinct from Hostage Taking because the target is a vehicle, regardless of whether there are people/passengers in the vehicle.\\n\\n5 = HOSTAGE TAKING (BARRICADE INCIDENT)\\nAn act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption of normal operations. Such attacks are distinguished from kidnapping since the incident occurs and usually plays out at the target location with little or no intention to hold the hostages for an extended period in a separate clandestine location.\\n\\n6 = HOSTAGE TAKING (KIDNAPPING)\\nAn act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption of normal operations. Kidnappings are distinguished from Barricade Incidents (above) in that they involve moving and holding the hostages in another location.\\n\\n7 = FACILITY / INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACK\\nAn act, excluding the use of an explosive, whose primary objective is to cause damage to a non-human target, such as a building, monument, train, pipeline, etc. Such attacks include arson and various forms of sabotage (e.g., sabotaging a train track is a facility/infrastructure attack, even if passengers are killed). Facility/infrastructure attacks can include acts which aim to harm an installation, yet also cause harm to people incidentally (e.g. an arson attack primarily aimed at damaging a building, but causes injuries or fatalities).\\n\\n8 = UNARMED ASSAULT\\nAn attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly to human beings by any means other than explosive, firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife, etc.). Attacks involving chemical, biological or radiological weapons are considered unarmed assaults.\\n\\n9 = UNKNOWN\\nThe attack type cannot be determined from the available information.\\n'}]\n",

It is calculated for each calendar year and is mainly defined as 'production plus imports minus exports' (quantities destroyed or used in certain applications like feedstock or quarantine and pre-shipment services are subtracted where relevant). As such, its formula can yield a negative number when substances are produced and imported in quantities that do not compensate for the amounts exported or destroyed. This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances. The latter is the current situation due to the fact that certain high-ODP substances are produced in the EU as by-products which, in general, are stocked before being destroyed.\"}]\n",

This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances.

For comparability, we have chosen to report only one source per country, favouring the source that provides the longest time series for each country. \\n\\nThe following is a list of sources underlying our UN estimates, from most to least coverage: UNSD, DHS_STATcompiler, National Statistics, MICS, the US Census Bureau, INED, Eurostat, and IPUMS. \\n\\nA full breakdown of the source used for each observation in this dataset can be found <a href=\"https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2020/01/oecd-un-mix-final-metadata-stand.csv\">here</a>.\\n\\n<strong>Further notes on Singulate Mean Age at Marriage</strong></br>\\nThe Singulate Mean Age at Marriage is derived from the proportion of single persons of each sex in successive age groups. The main assumption involved in this computation is that change in the proportion single from age x to x+1 is a measure of the proportion of a birth cohort who married at age x. The methodology enables computation of mean age at marriage of persons (male or female) aged 15 years and above before they attain the age of 50. In other words, it provides an estimate of the average number of years lived in the never married status by those who marry before the age of 50.\\n\\n<strong>OECD country series notes</strong></br>\\n- Estimates for Australia, New Zealand and the United States provide the median, rather than mean age at first marriage\\n- For Mexico, data refer to all marriages and not only first marriage\\n- For Canada, data include the legal union of two persons of the same sex in some provinces and territories from 2003 onwards, and in all of Canada from 2005 onwards.\\n- For New Zealand data include civil unions. From 2007 onwards, data include those who transferred their civil union to a marriage. \\n- From 2014 onwards, data for the United Kingdom include marriages between same-sex partners.'}]\n",

Our dataset updates their data through to 2017 using Inter-parliamentary union (IPU) statistical archives and the World Bank’s World Development Indicator (WDI) variable on women’s share in parliament (main sources).\\n\\nPaxton’s data is downloaded from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). It provides country-level data on the start and end year of sovereignty; year in which universal suffrage was granted to all women; the year the first woman was elected to parliament; and percentage share of women in parliament for the years 1945-2003. Data from 2003 onwards was derived from various sources. IPU’s statistical archives were used to derive figures on the share of women in parliament (from 2004-2017); the CIA World Factbook provided data on the year of sovereignty and universal suffrage, alongside various additional sources which are listed below. Moreover, this data extension to 2017 means our dataset consists of five additional countries: Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan and Timor, which gained independence after 2003. Paxton et al (2006) describes women’s political representation as the share of sovereign countries which satisfied the five representation milestones in any given year. We have therefore derived the number of sovereign countries generated in any given year, as well as the number which have attained each of the five milestones.\\n\\nTo overcome methodological differences, the attainment of milestones was assessed in two ways. Firstly, the number and share of sovereign countries were assessed relative to ‘ordered’ milestones. This results from Paxton et al’s (2006) assumption that a country only has an elected woman MP after universal suffrage is granted. However, there were 17 countries - Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, South Africa, USSR, United Kingdom, and the United States – whereby a female MP was elected prior to gaining universal suffrage. Secondly, we assessed the number and share of sovereign countries which independently satisfied five milestones.\\n\\nAdditional information on data sources: \\nThis section provides detailed information on the sources used by variables and countries.\\n\\nSovereignty \\nCIA’s World Factbook Independence field is used to determine the year of sovereignty for Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan, Timor, American Samoa, Hungary and Iran.

They use the share of women in single house for unicameral parliaments and lower house for bicameral parliaments. Moreover, for consistency, data is taken from December every year. If December data is missing, we take the next latest month of the corresponding year.\\nHandling data issues: \\nFor years 1997 - 2003, there is an overlap between Paxton’s dataset and WDI data measuring the share of women in parliament. For most countries, the values match exactly. However, there are 20-40 countries each year where the Paxton and WDI values do not match. As the more complete and comprehensive dataset, we have taken Paxton’s dataset as our primary source in such cases for the period 1997-2003. Nonetheless, we use WDI to fill the remaining gaps. For the same reasoning, we choose manually collected data from IPU’s statistical archive over WDI for the years 2004-2016.'}]\n",

This usually happens when export or destruction take place for ODS that were previously on the market in the EEA-33 (stocks). Additionally, different substances have different ODP values. If consumption is calculated in ODP tonnes, a negative value is also obtained when production/imports take place for low-ODP substances and export/destruction take place for high-ODP substances.

(2012) who created the Global Gender Gap index (GGG). The composite index includes the gender differences in four dimensions, health, socio-economic resources, household and politics. Health is measured by life expectancy and sex ratios whereas socio-economic resources are captured by average years of education and labour force participation. The gender disparities in the household are captured by the marriage ages and the data on distribution of parliamentary seats between men and women is used as an indication of gender disparities in the politics. Each of these variables is presented in female/male ratio. Before creating the composite index, values above 1 were truncated to be 1 except for sex ratio where the equality benchmark is set to be 0.944. For health and socio-economic resources, we have two indicators capturing these dimensions. We have given a weight to each of these indicators, so that the variable with higher standard deviation would not get a higher weight in the sub-index. Thus we normalize the variables in each sub-index by first determining what a 1% point change would translate into in the standard deviations (calculated by dividing .01 by the standard deviation of each variable), then determining the weight to each variable. As a final step, the total of the four sub-indexes was taken, divided by four and multiplied by 100 for the ease of interpretation. A higher score in our index thus highlights less gender inequality in favour of women. A more detailed discussion of the composite index is provided in Dilli et al. (2014).\\n\\nNote: this is an expanded version compared to the one released in 2014. In line with the procedure required for the How was life report (Carmichael et al. 2014), only decennial averages for the 25 clio-infra countries were reported.

It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. Water for the dairy and meat industries and industrial processing of harvested agricultural products is included under industrial water withdrawal.\"\\n\\nIndustrial water withdrawal: \"Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for industrial uses. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. This sector refers to self-supplied industries not connected to the public distribution network. The ratio between net consumption and withdrawal is estimated at less than 5%. It includes water for the cooling of thermoelectric and nuclear power plants, but it does not include hydropower. Water withdrawn by industries that are connected to the public supply network is generally included in municipal water withdrawal.\"\\n\\nMunicipal water withdrawal: \"Annual quantity of water withdrawn primarily for the direct use by the population. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It is usually computed as the total water withdrawn by the public distribution network. It can include that part of the industries and urban agriculture, which is connected to the municipal network. The ratio between the net consumption and the water withdrawn can vary from 5 to 15% in urban areas and from 10 to 50% in rural areas.\"\\n\\nIrrigation water requirement: \"The quantity of water exclusive of precipitation and soil moisture (i.e. quantity of irrigation water) required for normal crop production. It consists of water to ensure that the crop receives its full crop water requirement (i.e. irrigation consumptive water use, as well as extra water for flooding of paddy fields to facilitate land preparation and protect the plant and for leaching salt when necessary to allow for plant growth). It is usually expressed in water depth (millimetres) or water volume (m3) and may be stated in monthly, seasonal or annual terms, or for a crop period. It corresponds to net irrigation water requirement.\"\\n\\nIrrigation water withdrawal: \"Annual quantity of water withdrawn for irrigation purposes. In the AQUASTAT database water withdrawal for irrigation is part of agricultural water withdrawal, together with water withdrawal for livestock (watering and cleaning) and water withdrawal for aquaculture. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. The amount of water withdrawn for irrigation by far exceeds the consumptive use of irrigation because of water lost in its distribution from its source to the crops. The term \"water requirement ratio\" (sometimes also called \"irrigation efficiency\") is used to indicate the ratio between the net irrigation water requirements or crop water requirements, which is the volume of water needed to compensate for the deficit between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation over the growing period of the crop, and the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation including the losses. In the specific case of paddy rice irrigation, additional water is needed for flooding to facilitate land preparation and for plant protection. In that case, irrigation water requirements are the sum of rainfall deficit and the water needed to flood paddy fields. At scheme level, water requirement ratio values can vary from less than 20 percent to more than 80 percent.\"\\n\\nTotal water withdrawal: \"Annual quantity of water withdrawn for agricultural, industrial and municipal purposes. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It does not include in-stream uses, which are characterized by a very low net consumption rate, such as recreation, navigation, hydropower, inland capture fisheries, etc.\"'}]\n",

Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: \"the underlying cause of death refers to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury.\" Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.\\r\\nRisk factors are particular behaviors or lifestyle factors which affect the probability of incidence of particular diseases and causes of death. For example, tobacco smoking is a risk factor which increases the probability of lung cancer. In this case, it is not tobacco smoking in itself which is the cause of death, but the increased incidence of lung cancer.\\r\\nIn order to identify and highlight the specific behaviours, lifestyle factors - and thereby the potential intervention points for prevention of mortality - this data presents a mix of causes of death and risk factors. Many of the variables are straightforward causes of death - such as road accidents, drowning, fire, malaria, terrorism fatalities. However, for non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer, diabetes, which can form a complex combination of preceding behaviour and lifestyle factors we have instead presented the IHME\\'s attributed figures by risk factors, including high blood pressure, obesity, high blood sugar & tobacco smoking. Identification of these factors is more conducive to highlighting the specific behaviours or preventative factors which can be addressed in order to improve health outcomes and reduce mortality rates.\\r\\nCauses and risk factors are further clarified as follows:\\r\\n\\'Outdoor air pollution\\' refers to outdoor/ambient exposure to particulate matter (PM) and ozone.\\r\\n\\'Drug use\\' refers to the use of cannabis, opioids, or amphetamines, or use of injecting drugs [does not include tobacco or alcohol]. This is distinguished from \\'drug disorders\\' which refers to direct death as a result of drug dependence and drug abuse.\\r\\n\\'Alcohol disorders\\' refers to death as a result of alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse; this is distinguishable from \\'alcohol use\\', which is premature death as a result of general alcohol consumption which is linked to increased risk of certain diseases.\\r\\n\\'Road accidents\\' includes deaths from all road vehicles, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Nutritional deficiencies\\' are defined as protein-energy malnutrition, iodine, vitamin-A, and iron deficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'}]\n",

WHO Global Health Expenditure Database: http://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en', 'retrievedDate': '01/04/2017', 'additionalInfo': 'Definitions\\n\\nThe definition used by the World Health Organization (WHO) stipulates: “Public health expenditure consists of recurrent and capital spending from government (central and local) budgets, external borrowings and grants (including donations from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations), and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds.”\\n\\nIn some studies and reports, capital expenditure is not included as part of total expenditure (public or private). This is the case, for example, with OECD figures. However, in this dataset we take the WHO definition as a basis, and hence capital expenditures are included.\\n\\nWhether reporting agencies include capital expenditure as part of healthcare expenditure depends on the System of Health Accounts (SHA) that is in place. The OECD figures use the SHA 2011, which is the latest revision. The WHO figure use a previous version.\\n\\nWhile it is widely accepted that the SHA 2011 is superior to previous versions, many countries still use previous versions. This means there is a tradeoff between coverage across countries, and data quality. In the interest of coverage, we have chosen to rely on WHO definitions.\\n\\nHandling of underlying sources\\n\\nThis dataset was constructed by combining four sources. These are Lindert (1994), OECD (1993), OECD.stat. and the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database (WHO GHED)\\n\\nThese four sources were combined as follows.\\n\\nFor the period 1995-2015 we report the figures as published in WHO GHED.\\nFor the period 1970-1994, we extended the recent figures (from WHO GHED) backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD.stat.\\nFor the period 1960-1969, we continue extending backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD (1993)\\nFor the period 1880-1930, we report observations from Lindert (1994).\\nTo be precise, the process of extrapolation consisted in taking the earliest available observation from WHO GHED, and then successively extending the series backwards; first by using the year-by-year rate of change implied by the estimates in OECD.stat, for the period 1970-1994; and then using the year-by-year rate of change in OECD (1993), for the period 1960-1969. Here is an example:\\n\\nWHO_(year-1)= WHO_year x [OECD.stat_(year-1)]/[OECD.stat_(year)]\\n\\nBackward extrapolation was necessary because the levels in the estimates from WHO GHED, OECD.stat and OECD (1993) do not exactly coincide for the overlapping years. This is partly because OECD.stat data does not include capital expenditure.\\n\\nThe implicit assumption in our constructed dataset, then, is that the estimates from these three series have different levels, but common trends. Empirically, the validity of this assumption is supported by the trends in the overlapping years.'}]\n",

The database does not include acts of state terrorism.\\n\\nIn addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:\\n- Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.\\n- Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.\\n- Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law (particularly the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians or non-combatants).\\n\\nIs it defined as a suicide attack?\\nThis variable is coded “Yes” in those cases where there is evidence that the perpetrator did not intend to escape from the attack alive. \\n\\nSuccessful vs. unsuccessful attacks:\\n\"The GTD does include attacks that were attempted but ultimately unsuccessful. The circumstances vary depending on tactics (for details see the success variable, below). However, in general if a bomb is planted but fails to detonate; if an arsonist is intercepted by authorities before igniting a fire; or, if an assassin attempts and fails to kill his or her intended target, the attack is considered for inclusion in the GTD, but denoted as unsuccessful.\\n\\nSuccess of a terrorist strike is defined according to the tangible effects of the attack. Success is not judged in terms of the larger goals of the perpetrators. For example, a bomb that exploded in a building would be counted as a success even if it did not succeed in bringing the building down or inducing government repression. The definition of a successful attack depends on the type of attack. Essentially, the key question is whether or not the attack type took place. If a case has multiple attack types, it is successful if any of the attack types are successful, with the exception of assassinations, which are only successful if the intended target is killed.\"\\n\\nFatalities are defined as:\\n\"The number of total confirmed fatalities for the incident. The number includes all victims and attackers who died as a direct result of the incident. Where there is evidence of fatalities, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident. Likewise, if information on the number of perpetrators killed in an attack is missing, but victim fatalities are known, this field will only report the number of victims killed in the incident.\"\\n\\nInjuries are:\\n\"the number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to both perpetrators and victims.\"'}]\n",

The three selected predictor variables in the regression model are: GDP, the general fertility rate (GFR) and the proportion of skilled attendants at birth.'}]\n",

The index value for a given year depends on how often heat waves occur and how widespread they are.\\n\\nUnusually high and low temperatures measure the percentage of the country’s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter.

When a victim is attacked specifically because of his or her relationship to a particular person, such as a prominent figure, the target type reflects that motive. For\\nexample, if a family member of a government official is attacked because of his or her relationship to that individual, the type of target is “government.” \\n\\nThis variable consists of the following 22 categories:\\n1 = BUSINESS\\nBusinesses are defined as individuals or organizations engaged in commercial or mercantile activity as a means of livelihood. Any attack on a business or private citizens patronizing a business such as a restaurant, gas station, music store, bar, café, etc. This includes attacks carried out against corporate offices or employees of firms like mining companies, or oil corporations. Furthermore, includes attacks conducted on business people or corporate officers. Included in this value as well are hospitals and chambers of commerce and cooperatives. Does not include attacks carried out in public or quasi-public areas such as “business district or commercial area”, or generic business-related individuals such as\\n“businessmen” (these attacks are captured under “Private Citizens and Property”, see below.) Also does not include attacks against generic business-related individuals such as “businessmen.” Unless the victims were targeted because of their specific business affiliation, these attacks belong in “Private Citizens and Property.”\\n\\n2 = GOVERNMENT (GENERAL)\\nAny attack on a government building; government member, former members, including members of political parties in official capacities, their convoys, or events sponsored by political parties; political movements; or a government sponsored institution where the attack is expressly carried out to harm the government. This value includes attacks on judges, public attorneys (e.g., prosecutors), courts and court systems, politicians, royalty, head of state, government employees (unless police or military), election-related attacks, or intelligence agencies and spies. This value does not include attacks on political candidates for office or members of political parties that do not hold an elected office (these attacks are captured in “Private Citizens and Property”).\\n\\n3 = POLICE\\nThis value includes attacks on members of the police force or police installations; this includes police boxes, patrols headquarters, academies, cars, checkpoints, etc. Includes attacks against jails or prison facilities, or jail or prison staff or guards.\\n\\n4 = MILITARY\\nIncludes attacks against military units, patrols, barracks, convoys, jeeps, and aircraft. Also includes attacks on recruiting sites, and soldiers engaged in internal policing functions such as at checkpoints and in anti narcotics activities. This category also includes peacekeeping units that conduct military operations (e.g., AMISOM). Excludes attacks against non-state militias and guerrillas, these types of attacks are coded as “Terrorist/Non-state Militias” see below.\\n\\n5 = ABORTION RELATED\\nAttacks on abortion clinics, employees, patrons, or security personnel stationed at clinics.\\n\\n6 = AIRPORTS & AIRCRAFT\\nAn attack that was carried out either against an aircraft or against an airport. Attacks against airline employees while on board are also included in this value. Includes attacks conducted against airport business offices and executives. Military aircraft are not included.\\n\\n7 = GOVERNMENT (DIPLOMATIC)\\nAttacks carried out against foreign missions, including embassies, consulates, etc. This value includes cultural centers that have diplomatic functions, and attacks against diplomatic staff and their families (when the relationship is relevant to the motive of the attack) and property. The United Nations is a diplomatic target.\\n\\n8 = EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION\\nAttacks against schools, teachers, or guards protecting school sites. Includes attacks against university professors, teaching staff and school buses. Moreover, includes attacks against religious schools in this value. As noted below in the “Private Citizens and Property” value, the GTD has several attacks against students. If attacks involving students are not expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are carried out in an educational setting, they are coded as private citizens and property. Excludes attacks against military schools (attacks on military schools are coded as “Military,” see below).\\n\\n9 = FOOD OR WATER SUPPLY\\nAttacks on food or water supplies or reserves are included in this value. This generally includes attacks aimed at the infrastructure related to food and water for human consumption.\\n\\n10 = JOURNALISTS & MEDIA\\nIncludes, attacks on reporters, news assistants, photographers, publishers, as well as attacks on media headquarters and offices.

NGOs here include large multinational non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross and Doctors without Borders, as well as domestic organizations.\\n\\n13= OTHER\\nThis value includes acts of terrorism committed against targets which do not fit into other categories. Some examples include ambulances, firefighters, and international demilitarized zones.\\n\\n14= PRIVATE CITIZENS & PROPERTY\\nThis value includes attacks on individuals, the public in general or attacks in public areas including markets, commercial streets, busy intersections and pedestrian malls. Also includes ambiguous cases where the target/victim was a named individual, or where the target/victim of an attack could be identified by name, age, occupation, gender or nationality. This value also includes ceremonial events, such as weddings and funerals. The GTD contains a number of attacks against students. If these attacks are not expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are not carried out in an educational setting, these attacks are coded using this value. Also, includes incidents involving political supporters as private citizens and property, provided that these supporters are not part of a government-sponsored event. Finally, this value includes police informers. Does not include attacks causing civilian casualties in businesses such as restaurants, cafes or movie theaters (these categories are coded as “Business” see above).\\n\\n15 = RELIGIOUS FIGURES/INSTITUTIONS\\nThis value includes attacks on religious leaders, (Imams, priests, bishops, etc.), religious institutions (mosques, churches), religious places or objects (shrines, relics, etc.). This value also includes attacks on organizations that are affiliated with religious entities that are not NGOs, businesses or schools. Attacks on religious pilgrims are considered “Private Citizens and Property;” attacks on missionaries are considered religious figures.\\n\\n16 = TELECOMMUNICATION\\nThis includes attacks on facilities and infrastructure for the transmission of information.

Membership is broadly defined and includes informants for terrorist groups, but excludes former or surrendered terrorists.\\nThis value also includes cases involving the targeting of militias and guerillas.\\n\\n18 = TOURISTS\\nThis value includes the targeting of tour buses, tourists, or “tours.” Tourists are persons who travel primarily for the purposes of leisure or amusement. Government tourist offices are included in this value. The attack must clearly target tourists, not just an assault on a business or transportation system used by tourists. Travel agencies are coded as business targets.\\n\\n19 = TRANSPORTATION (OTHER THAN AVIATION)\\nAttacks on public transportation systems are included in this value. This can include efforts to assault public buses, minibuses, trains, metro/subways, highways (if the highway itself is the target of the attack), bridges, roads, etc. The GTD contains a number of attacks on generic terms such as “cars” or “vehicles.” These attacks are assumed to be against “Private Citizens and Property” unless shown to be against public transportation systems. In this regard, buses are assumed to be public transportation unless otherwise noted.\\n\\n20 = UNKNOWN\\nThe target type cannot be determined from the available information.\\n\\n21 = UTILITIES\\nThis value pertains to facilities for the transmission or generation of energy. For example, power lines, oil pipelines, electrical transformers, high tension lines, gas and electric substations, are all included in this value. This value also includes lampposts or street lights. Attacks on officers, employees or facilities of utility companies excluding the type of facilities above are coded as business.\\n\\n22 = VIOLENT POLITICAL PARTIES\\nThis value pertains to entities that are both political parties (and thus, coded as “government” in this coding scheme) and terrorists. It is operationally defined as groups that engage in electoral politics and appear as “Perpetrators” in the GTD.'}]\n",

To achieve this level of granularity, the World Bank relies on interpolation for countries in which survey data are not available in particular years, but are available either before or after (or both). The process of interpolation requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the missing year.

More and more countries are becoming increasing dependent on reliable and secure electricity supplies to underpin economic growth and community prosperity. This reliance is set to grow as more efficient and less carbon intensive forms of power are developed and deployed to help decarbonize economies. Energy is necessary for creating the conditions for economic growth. It is impossible to operate a factory, run a shop, grow crops or deliver goods to consumers without using some form of energy. Access to electricity is particularly crucial to human development as electricity is, in practice, indispensable for certain basic activities, such as lighting, refrigeration and the running of household appliances, and cannot easily be replaced by other forms of energy. Individuals\\' access to electricity is one of the most clear and un-distorted indication of a country\\'s energy poverty status. Electricity access is increasingly at the forefront of governments\\' preoccupations, especially in the developing countries. As a consequence, a lot of rural electrification programs and national electrification agencies have been created in these countries to monitor more accurately the needs and the status of rural development and electrification. Use of energy is important in improving people\\'s standard of living. But electricity generation also can damage the environment. Whether such damage occurs depends largely on how electricity is generated. For example, burning coal releases twice as much carbon dioxide - a major contributor to global warming - as does burning an equivalent amount of natural gas.\\n\\nLong Definition: Access to electricity is the percentage of population with access to electricity. Electrification data are collected from industry, national surveys and international sources.\\n\\nPeriodicity: Annual\\n\\nStatistical Concept and Methodology: Data for access to electricity are collected among different sources: mostly data from nationally representative household surveys (including national censuses) were used. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities). Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of zero to three data points. There are 42 countries with zero data point and the weighted regional average was used as an estimate for electrification in each of the data periods. 170 countries have between one and three data points and missing data are estimated by using a model with region, country, and time variables. The model keeps the original observation if data is available for any of the time periods. This modelling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these three time periods (Indicated as \"Estimate\"). Notation \"Assumption\" refers to the assumption of universal access in countries classified as developed by the United Nations.'}]\n",

', 'dataPublisherSource': 'Historical data. ', 'link': 'Appendix kindly sent by Daniel Sichel.', 'retrievedDate': '15/02/2018', 'additionalInfo': 'There are three main types of nails: hand forged, machine cut, and wire. Blacksmiths produced hand forged nails until about 1820. Cut nails have been produced using a machine which cuts nails from sheets of iron or steel - technology patents for this machinery emerging in the late 18th century. Wire nails became more widely produced in the late 19th century with individual nails cut from a coil of drawn wire, one end sharpened at the tip, and the head of the nail added to the other (Sichel (2017)). \\r\\n\\r\\nReal prices are calculated using Sichel’s (2017) consumer price index (CPI) dating back to 1695 constructed from the UK retail price index (RPI) from 1695-1784, and US CPI from 1784-2011. 2010 is used as the base year, so all prices adjusted for inflation are in terms of 2010 dollars. To calculate real price of nails in cents/lb, we use the following procedure:\\r\\n\\r\\nReal price of nails (cents/lb) = Nominal price of nails (cents/lb) divided by (CPI /100) \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the real price of nails measured in units of cents per pound can obscure quality differences. To adjust for differences in quality, Sichel (2017) standardizes nail sizes, converting all nails to be as close as possible to a 2”, size 6d nail, to construct real prices in cents per nail. The counts of nails per pound used for each year can be found in Table 3 of Sichel’s (2017) working paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn calculating the real price of nails (cents/nail), we first convert units from cents per pound to cents per nail, and then convert from nominal to real prices. \\r\\n\\r\\nNominal price of nails (cents/nail) = Nominal price of nail (cents/lb) x 1/[count of nails per pound]\\r\\n\\r\\nReal price of nails (cents/nail) = Nominal price of nails (cents/nail) divided by (CPI/100)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nominal price series for nails, from which the real series have been constructed, are comprised of multiple data sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1695 to 1792, prices are from Beveridge (1939) in the United Kingdom. Where data is not reported for selected years, the values for these years are interpolated. Prices have been converted from shillings to cents. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the period 1784 to 1813 prices are sourced from Cole (1938) although the type of nails have not been specified and are thus assumed to be mixed (forged and cut) nails. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1814 to 1890 data covers machine-cut nail prices. Between 1814 and 1828, prices are taken from Cole (1938). Quotes for later years are from various sources with the data reproduced in ‘Historical Statistics of the United States’. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe period covering 1890 up until 2011 refers to wire nails. This section of the data series includes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \\r\\nFor greater detail in the construction of this dataset, please see Sichel’s (2017)* working paper referenced below. \\r\\n\\r\\nReferences: \\r\\n\\r\\nBeveridge, William (1939), Prices and Wages in England from the Twelfth to the Nineteenth Century, Vol. I, Price Tables: Mercantile Era, Longmans, Green, and Co., London.\\r\\n\\r\\nCole, Arthur Harrison (1938), Wholesale Commodity Prices in the United States 1700-1861, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Sichel, Daniel E.

We decided to use a slightly lower threshold than Hosonuma et al (2012). We also manually adjusted the classification for a few post-transition countries that were not classified as such and excluded countries with less than 5% forest cover.\"\\n\\nHosonuma describe the Forest Transition Model as:\\n\"The four FT phases are pre-transition, early transition, late transition and post-transition, which generally represent a time sequence of national development. Pre-transition countries have high forest cover and low deforestation rates. In early-transition countries, forest cover is lost at an increasingly rapid rate. Late-transition countries with a rather small fraction of remaining forests exhibit a slowing of the deforestation rate and eventually come into the post-transition phase, where the forest area change rate becomes positive and forest cover increases through reforestation. The FT model reflects a broad-scale typology of tropical developing countries, applicable as a proxy for analyzing the temporal variability of drivers of deforestation and forest degradation.\"\\n\\nAdditional references:\\nHosonuma, N., Herold, M., De Sy, V., De Fries, R.

(2016) assessed death rates from accidents from low-carbon energy sources (nuclear and renewables) based on historical records spanning the period 1990 to 2013.\\n\\nWhen we try to combine the two analyses referenced earlier, one issue we encounter is that neither study includes both of the major nuclear accidents in its death rate figure: Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) was published before the Fukushima disaster in 2011; and Sovacool et al. (2016) only look at death rates since 1990, and therefore do not include the 1986 Chernobyl accident. We have therefore reconstructed the death rate for nuclear to include both of these accidents.\\n\\nFor Chernobyl, there are several death estimates. We rely on the estimate published by the World Health Organization (WHO) – the most-widely cited figure – although this is considered to be too high by several researchers, including a later report by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). The WHO estimates that 4000 people have, or will die, from the Chernobyl disaster. This includes the death of 31 people as a direct result of the disaster and those expected to die at a later date from cancers due to radiation exposure.\\n\\nThe disaster in Fukushima killed 574 people. In 2018, the Japanese government reported that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event. No one died directly from the Fukushima disaster. Instead, most people died as a result of evacuation procedures. According to Japanese authorities 573 people died due to the impact of the evacuation and stress.\\n\\nTo the death toll of history’s two nuclear disasters we have added the death rate that Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) estimated for occupational deaths, most from milling and mining.

The data has been standardized following a six-step process: \\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Step 1: Annualizing consumption or expenditure data:\\nIn simple cases, this amounts to using a multiplying factor determined by the recall period (the period in which households are asked to recall their expenditure during that period). For example, food data collected for the last 7 days would be divided by 7, then multiplied by 365; monthly values by 12 etc. </li>\\n<li> Step 2: Detecting and fixing outliers:\\nExpenditure values were flagged to be outliers if they exceeded the average amount consumed in the third quartile plus 5 times the interquartile range (the difference between the first and third quartiles of the data). \\nAny flagged values need to be confirmed before imputations are made. If three or more non-food values are flagged as outliers for a household, it was assumed this indicates a rich household; hence the flags were removed. Households in the top two consumption quintiles were also assumed to spend unusually large shares of their income on education and jewellery. Outlier values that did not fit either of these criteria were replaced with the weighted mean of the non-extreme values for the consumption variable in question. </li>\\n<li> Step 3: Mapping commodities to the ICP/COICOP classification:\\nCommodities found in each survey dataset were mapped to a standard classification of products and services, and then aggregate standard products and services into sectors and categories. This used the International Comparison Program (ICP) classification which is equivalent to the International Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP). </li>\\n<li> Step 4: Extrapolation to 2010:\\nExtrapolations were undertaken to convert all consumption and population data to a common reference year, 2010. For example, for the 2007 survey conducted in Guinea: final consumption expenditure per capita in LCU was 3,177,774 in 2010 and 1,547,012 in 2007 (the survey year). All survey values were therefore multiplied by 3,177,774/1,547,012=2.054137. \\nConsumption data were converted from local currencies to international dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP$). </li>\\n<li> Step 5: Review and validation: \\nData was compared with other sources, notably the respective survey reports, and the World Bank’s poverty dataset, Povcalnet. </li>\\n<li> Step 6: Production of summary tables and metadata:\\nThe World Bank generated of a standard set of tables for each country showing consumption and demographic patterns across consumption segments. </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nFor more information on the Global Consumption Database methodology see: http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/detail under the ‘Standardization of Data’ tab.\\n\\nAs the World Bank’s Global Consumption Database draws on a variety of country surveys which differ in design, methodology, and timing, there are limits to the extent to which surveys can be standardized. Therefore, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution. For more information see http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/detail under the ‘Note on comparability’ tab.\\n\\nAll figures reported are based on national totals. The World Bank notes “each survey is composed of ordinary households only; “institutional households” (prisons, military barracks, hospitals, convents, and others) are not covered by household surveys. Homeless and nomadic populations and visitors present in a country during a survey are also excluded from the sample.” \\n\\nThe surveys used in the database were conducted between 2000 and 2010.

That is, a table with countries in the rows and product categories in the columns, so that each cell in the table shows the value of country-product exports.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this matrix, ‘diversification’ is obtained from the distribution of country exports across products (i.e. the sum across columns for each row); while ‘ubiquity’  is given by the share of product exports contributed by each country (i.e. the sum across rows for each column).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo condense both dimensions into a single metric, the ECI further reduces the information in the matrix, such that countries with similar exports are close together in the ranking. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoosely speaking, lower ECI scores correspond to countries that export very few different types of products (i.e. export baskets that are not diversified) and those products that they do export are produced in many other countries (i.e. export baskets that load heavily on just a few ubiquitous products). \\r\\n\\r\\nBy this logic, Germany has a high ECI score because it exports many different kinds of sophisticated things that are only produced by a handful of other countries with similarly diversified productive capacities. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following visualization shows ECI rankings for all countries in the world.

If a country exporting petroleum can only produce a few other products, then the low ubiquity for their export basket can be explained by these natural resources, and the ECI ranking is corrected by the country’s inability to produce different types of products. However, if this country can also produce a diverse range of other goods, then low ubiquity correctly indicates greater economic complexity which is reflected in the ranking. Hence, information on diversity can correct for the information of ubiquity, and vice versa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe data here comes from the Economic Complexity Index scores published by the MIT Observatory of Economic Complexity.

Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants only or (2) average time spent for all population of certain age. In the former type of averages the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof) regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. All statistics presented in the Minimum Set on Gender Indicators on time spent in various activities are averages based on all total relevant population. This type of averages can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants or both. Data presented for this indicator are expressed as an average per day. It is averaged over seven days of the week (weekdays and weekends are not differentiated).\"'}]\n",

Currently this data is not available as a time-series, and is limited to measurement in a single census year. Note that this census year is not consistent across all countries. Data for most European and North American countries is based on 2010-11 datasets, whereas other countries can extend from 1993-2011. For graphing consistency, this has been shown as a single year (e.g. assuming these figures are representative of 2011). The actual years of measurement for each country can be found in the referenced FAO report and database.\\n\\nThe FAO\\'s publication on its Gender and Land Rights Database notes the following definition:\\n\"The agricultural landowner is defined as the legal owner of the agricultural land; however, definitions of ownership may vary across countries and surveys. The indicator may not necessarily reflect documented ownership certified by a legal document. Especially in places where much of the land is not formally titled or documented, surveys often simply ask whether someone in the household owns the land, and if so, who owns it. In addition to officially titled ownership, it may also include proxies, such as the right to use, sell or bequeath the land, or the right to use it as collateral. This enables the indicator to capture different aspects of the “bundle of rights” related to land, rather than land ownership in the strictest sense of the term. The current indicator in the GLRD uses different definitions of ownership; they are specified for each country in the data notes. As data for more countries become available, it will be useful to calculate these measures using more than one definition of ownership.\\n\\nAn individual is defined as a landowner whether they own land solely (they are the only owner of a plot of land) or jointly with someone inside or outside the household. Thus, households may have multiple landowners. In addition, households may own multiple plots of land with different owners identified for each plot.\"\\n\\nReferences:\\nFAO (2015).
